Making predictions on gold prices is not easy because this process is influenced by several economic and financial elements. The Random Forest regression algorithm was used in this project to predict the price of gold using variables like USO, SLV, EUR/USD and SPX. This study aims at determining if the r-squared mean metric can be useful to assess the accuracy rate of the prediction model and creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

To start with, the project collects historical data about gold prices, USO, GLD (SPDR Gold Shares), SLV, EUR/USD, and SPX. Preprocessing step handles missing data, normalizes them and splits into training and testing sets so that input data quality may be ensured.

2. Model Training with Random Forest Regression

The Random Forest regression algorithm is then employed to train the learning model based on the training set. Among other reasons why Random Forest is preferred are its robustness and ability to manage intricate datasets: it divides them into many decision trees which are later merged together so as to improve their results while at the same time minimizing overfitting.

3. Model Evaluation

The R-squared mean metric is calculated using the test dataset to measure the accuracy of the model. This metric measures what percentage of gold price variation can be explained by factors in the model. A higher R-squared mean value explains that forecast is more accurate revealing how efficient the model has been at studying gold price trends and other influential factors.

4. Development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A simple GUI was developed for ease of use. With this interface, users can enter values for USO, SLV, EUR/USD and SPX; then based on these inputs, the trained model predicts the corresponding gold price. The tool can be used in real-time, making it a user-friendly approach towards understanding gold price predictions thereby helping individuals to make an informed decision.

5. Project Outcomes and Insights

This project shows how good Random Forest algorithm is at predicting gold prices. The R-squared mean metric gives an indication on how accurate are our models as far as influencing factors to price movements are concerned. It improves user interaction experience with results being personalized according to scenarios under consideration.
